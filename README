Net::LPR version 1.007
======================

DESCRIPTION

This module implements a low-level interface into a line printer daemon
connection.  It implements all the commands listed in RFC 1179, including
queue control commands and output file formatting commands.

Using this module, it should be possible to implement pure-Perl
replacements for the entire Berkeley printer suite (lpr, lpq, lprm, lpc,
etc.).

If anyone does so, let me know and I'll bundle it with the module for all
to enjoy. :-)
